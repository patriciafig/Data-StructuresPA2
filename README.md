# Data-StructuresPA2
This project implements a Bag class to function as a word search engine program.
The program allows users to find words among a given set of text files. 
The program takes a path to a directory as an input. The directory contains a set of files consisting of multiple words.
A word can appear multiple times in a single file, or in multiple files.
The program reads all the files, parses file content into words, and feeds the words to a Bag object.
